All scripts are provided as parts of the course, but I amended them a bit and added some comments.

- "listgen.py" - Generators of lists, dictionaries and sets. Example: how to get a list of exe-files large than 2 MB.
- "lmbd.py" - Lambda functions.
- "sort.py" - Sort an existing list or create a new sorted list.
- "map_func.py" - 'map' function to create a new list from other lists with the same length, applying a function to each of their elements.
- "zip_func.py" - 'zip' function to create a new list, where each element is a tuple with elements of other lists. Example: how to find a middle point in 3D space, if several points are known.
- "gen.py" - Generators functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a 'for' loop (using keyword 'yield' instead of 'return').
- "contextmanager.py" - Construction 'with', like 'with open('c:\file')'. Methods '\_\_enter\_\_' and '\_\_exit\_\_'. Example: timer to measure, how much time a process took.

----------
- "getpath.py" - Current folder, OS-based user folders and TEMP folders.
- "zip_example.py" - Create ZIP-archives and unpack them.
- "glb.py" - Module 'glob' to find files by names. Example: how to get a list of exe-files with names ending with a digit.
