All scripts are provided as parts of the course, but I amended them a bit and added some comments.

- "simpleWidget.py" - a window with a label and a button, that do nothing.
- "simpleClassWidget.py" - the same simple widget, but defined as a class.
- "connect.py" - working with signals and slots. Example: an action when a button is clicked.


NB: Pay attention, that you need to install PySide first:
