The script allows you to create a folder tree.
It is useful, if you have to create folders for different projects with the same sub-folders regularly.

Requirements:
- MS Windows with Russian regional and language settings.
- Python 2.7.
- TXT-file, describing a folder tree (encoding cp1251).

How to use:
- Put the TXT-file in a folder, where you want to create a project folder.
- Drag and drop the TXT-file on the script.
- Enter the project name in English or Russian.

What is different from the example:
- The folder tree isn't a part of the script.
- The root folder for the project isn't a part of the script.
- Folder names can be not only in English, but in Russian too(encoding cp1251).
- A project name can be not only in English, but in Russian too(encoding cp866).

What I haven't managed to do:
- I wanted to use a user-friendly format for TXT-file (with TAB to make a folder tree), but I had to use a list (Python data structure).
