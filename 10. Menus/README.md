All scripts are provided as parts of the course, but I amended them a bit and added some comments.

- "windowMenu.py" - a menu for QMainWindow.
- "widgetMenu.py" - a context menu for any widget, for example QLineEdit.
- "button.py" - a module to be imported by widgetMenu.py to demonstrate two different context menu behaviors: on the button it opens on mouse down (press the button), but on the line edit - on mouse up (release the button).



NB: Pay attention, that you need to install PySide first:
