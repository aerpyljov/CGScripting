Project Manager is an application for managing projects.
Project is a folder with subfolders and files, plus a specific file with the project info.

It is useful, if you regularly have to create folders with the same structure of nested child folders.

The main use cases of the application:
- Display the list of projects with their descriptions.
- Open project folders.
- Customize the project template (subfolders names and nested structure).
- Change the app settings (the root folder for all project folders).


NB: Pay attention, that you need to install PySide first:

To install it on Ubuntu Linux I had to run these commands first: 
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev qt4-qmake libxslt-dev libxml2-dev cmake
