The script is provided as a part of the course, but I amended it a bit and added some comments.

The widget demonstrates how drag & drop works.
Its features:  
- Drag files with the left mouse button and drop them on the widget: they'll be displayed in a list.
- Select rows in the list and drag them with the left mouse button: nothing will happen. Only the middle button works.
- Select rows in the list, drag them and drop in a folder: you'll see the standard menu for drag'n'dropping files between folders.
- Repeat, but drop on another copy of the widget: the rows will move.
- Repeat, but drop on the same widget or any other place: nothing will happen.
- A custom icon is displayed near the cursor when you drag rows from the widget.



NB: Pay attention, that you need to install PySide first:
