All scripts are provided as parts of the course, but I amended them a bit and added some comments.

- "divider.py" - Encapsulation (no direct access to the class attributes, only by the class methods)
- "phone.py" - Inheritance (using "super" to use the parent class methods)
- "vector.py" - Polymorphism (define methods like "\_\_str\_\_", "\_\_call\_\_", "\_\_add\_\_" and so on)
- "static.py" - Static methods and variables (can be used without class instances)
- "decorator.py" - Decorators (some actions before and after calling other functions; take a functon as an argument, return another function)
